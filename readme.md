Part of our upcoming RPG course on Udemy, see our course list [here](https://www.udemy.com/u/bentristem/). The full course is part of [this ](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bentristem/your-ideal-rpg-make-a-complete-role-playing-game-i) kickstarter campaign which was over 200% funded.

These are just the files from the course, not the actual tutorial videos. This course is exclusively hosted on Udemy.com, and has many hours of high-quality videos.
