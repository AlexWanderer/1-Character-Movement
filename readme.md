## About This Repo
Part of our upcoming RPG course on Udemy, see our course list [here](https://www.udemy.com/u/bentristem/). The full course is part of [this ](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bentristem/your-ideal-rpg-make-a-complete-role-playing-game-i) kickstarter campaign which was over 200% funded.

These are just the files from the course, not the actual tutorial videos. This course is exclusively hosted on Udemy.com, and has many hours of high-quality videos.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files!

## How To Build / Compile
This is a Unity project. If you're familiar with source control, then "clone this repo". Otherwise download the contents, and navigate to `Assets > Levels` then open any `.unity` file.

This branch is a prototype branch, the code is not final and many bugs exist. The project will be rebuilt on the `course` branch as the course is created.
